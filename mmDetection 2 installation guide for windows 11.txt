config: windows 11 + Anaconda + python 3.7 + CUDA 11.3 + PyTorch 1.10.1 + mmcv-full 1.4.0 + mmDetection 2.19.1
(mmcv-full 1.4.1 + mmDetection 2.19.1 --> .DLL not found error)
tutorial referring to https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/396934340
Prerequisite: git and C++ build tools 14.0 (or above) have been installed in windows and added to PATH environment variable

1. Install Anaconda

2. Install Nvidia driver and CUDA to local machine (add CUDA/bin to PATH environment variable)
To verify Nvidia driver: in Anaconda Powershell Prompt, type 'Nvidia-smi' and see any output
To verify CUDA: in Anaconda Powershell Pro,pt, type 'nvcc -V' and see any output

3. Create conda virtual environment: conda create -n openmmlab python=3.7
To activate virtual environment: type 'conda activate openmmlab'

4. Install Pytorch by 'conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch'

5. Install opencv by 'pip install opencv-python' and 'pip install opencv-contrib-python'

6. Check https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cuXXX/torchY.Y.Y/index.html
e.g. if you are having cuda 11.3 and pytorch 1.10.0 / 1.10.1 etc --> XXX=113, Y.Y.Y = 1.10.0
make sure the version of mmcv matches with python, cuda, and pytorch version, with 'win_amd64' wheel
Install mmcv-full by 'pip install mmcv-full==1.4.0 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu111/torch1.8.0/index.html'
(mmcv==x.x.x based on what version you choose. If you want 1.4.1, then just type mmcv==1.4.1 etc)

7. Check https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/docs/en/get_started.md and see which appropriate version of mmDetection can be installed to match with your previously installed mmcv version
Type the following commands one by one (make sure you have git, or you can directly download the code from github):
git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection.git   
cd mmdetection
pip install -r requirements/build.txt
pip install -v -e .

8. Inside mmDetection folder, create a new folder and name it as 'checkpoints'
Download a faster-rcnn model from https://download.openmmlab.com/mmdetection/v2.0/faster_rcnn/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco_20200130-047c8118.pth
Save the model inside 'checkpoints' folder

9. To verify installation od mmDetection, open Anaconda powershell prompt, activate the corresponding environment, change directory to mmDetection folder, and type
'python demo/image_demo.py demo/demo.jpg configs/faster_rcnn/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py checkpoints/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco_20200130-047c8118.pth'
if a detection result (should be an image with many bounding boxes) appears, then the installation should be OK.
